# Data Structures and Algorithms using python

This project focuses on implementing various data structures and algorithms using the concepts of data structures and algorithms. The project includes the implementation of the following data structures and algorithms:

## Data Structures

### Double LinkedList
The Double LinkedList is a linear data structure in which each element is connected to the previous and next element, forming a chain-like structure. It allows efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the list.

### Queue using LinkedList
The Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The implementation of the Queue using a LinkedList provides efficient insertion at the rear and deletion at the front of the queue.

### Stack using LinkedList
The Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The implementation of the Stack using a LinkedList allows efficient insertion and deletion at one end of the stack.

### Preorder, Postorder, Inorder Trees
These are different traversal techniques used to visit the nodes of a binary tree in a specific order. Preorder traversal visits the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. Inorder traversal visits the left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. Postorder traversal visits the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.

## Algorithms

### 0-1 Knapsack using Dynamic Programming
The 0-1 Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science. It involves selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and value, to maximize the total value while keeping the total weight within a specified limit. The implementation of this algorithm using dynamic programming provides an efficient solution to this problem.

### Fibonacci Number using Dynamic Programming
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The implementation of the Fibonacci number algorithm using dynamic programming optimizes the computation by storing previously calculated values, leading to faster calculations for large Fibonacci numbers.

### Karatsuba Multiplication using Divide and Conquer
Karatsuba multiplication is a fast multiplication algorithm that uses the divide and conquer technique. It allows efficient multiplication of large numbers by breaking them down into smaller subproblems recursively. The implementation of this algorithm provides an efficient way to multiply large numbers.

### Merge Sort using Divide and Conquer
Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer approach. It divides the input array into two halves, sorts them individually, and then merges them to obtain a sorted output. The implementation of Merge Sort using the divide and conquer technique provides an efficient way to sort an array of elements.

### Fractional Knapsack using Greedy Algorithm
The Fractional Knapsack problem is another variation of the knapsack problem, where items can be divided and fractions of an item can be included. The implementation of the Fractional Knapsack algorithm using the greedy approach provides an efficient solution to maximize the value obtained while considering fractions of items.
